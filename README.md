# Single-Page CV

## Introduction

This project is the first project I am doing from the frontend [road map website](roadmap.sh) which has helped me learn  alot  and  [here is the URL](https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv) for the project.

The idea is to practice writing HTML and in the process make an online CV. Through this project, I will also learn how to work with SEO.

### <ins>Header</ins>

I used the regular HTML header 2 for the title of the page. While at it, I learnt that the ``` <hr> ``` tag is used for making horizontal lines in HTML.
