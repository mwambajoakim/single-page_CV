# Single-Page CV

## Introduction

This project is the first project I am doing from the frontend [road map website](roadmap.sh) which has helped me learn  alot  and  [here is the URL](https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv) for the project.

The idea is to practice writing HTML and in the process make an online CV. Through this project, I will also learn how to work with SEO.

### <ins>Header</ins>

I used the regular HTML header 2 for the title of the page. While at it, I learnt that the ``` <hr> ``` tag is used for making horizontal lines in HTML.

### <ins>Body</ins>

Well for the body I used a mix of ``` <h3> ``` and ``` <h4> ``` headers to make the titles of the different section and their children appear as the project overview I was given. 

I consistently used the ``` <h4> ``` header to write out the section of the CV and then used inline CSS to decorate as guided. Here is a snippet of this; ```  <h4 style="color: green;">Education</h4> ```

For the details that I wrote below the section, I would use ``` <h3> ``` for the headers and then write a paragrap below it with an unorder list of achivements and learnings depending on the section.

I decided to add a horizontal line after each section to separate them and for aesthetic. I also created a box or container around the content using a ``` <div> ``` and styled it a bit inline just so it coud pop out.

At the end there I did not add a footer because this is just a CV. I chose to add social media icons and add links to those socials.

Be sure to take a look and critique the work and show areas of improvement. I will appreciate any feedback given.

Here is a snippet of how it came out;
